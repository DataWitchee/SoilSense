## 🔍 Problem Statement

Soil testing provides nutrient values, but farmers often struggle to interpret them effectively.  
Incorrect crop selection leads to:

- Low productivity  
- Wasted resources  
- Degraded soil condition  

Soil Sense bridges this gap using an AI-based recommendation approach.

## 🎯 Objective

To assist farmers by providing **accurate crop recommendations** based on:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- pH level

---

##  Machine Learning Approach

- Data preparation and preprocessing using Pandas & NumPy  
- **Random Forest Classifier** model for prediction  
- Model performance evaluation (accuracy score)  
- Backend deployment using FastAPI for real-world use  

Random Forest was chosen because of its:

✔ High accuracy  
✔ Low overfitting  
✔ Good performance with small agricultural datasets
